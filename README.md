# To-Do App (Vite + React)

This is a **To-Do App** built using **React and Vite** as part of my learning journey in React. The application implements a **CRUD system** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and utilizes **local storage** to persist tasks.

## 🚀 Features
- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Edit tasks
- Delete tasks
- Filter tasks (e.g., completed, pending, all)
- Data persistence using **local storage**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **React** – for building the UI
- **Vite** – for fast development and optimized builds
- **Local Storage** – for saving tasks persistently
- **ESLint** – for code quality and best practices

## 📦 Installation
To get started, clone this repository and install dependencies:

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-app.git

# Navigate to the project folder
cd todo-app

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## 🚀 Running the Project
Start the development server with:

```sh
npm run dev
```
This will start the app on **http://localhost:5173/** by default.

## 🏗️ Building for Production
To create an optimized production build, run:

```sh
npm run build
```

## 📄 ESLint & Code Quality
The project follows ESLint rules for maintaining code consistency. You can check for linting issues with:

```sh
npm run lint
```

## 🔥 Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
Vite enables **HMR** by default, allowing instant updates to the UI without reloading the page.

## 📌 Notes
- The app stores tasks in **local storage**, meaning tasks persist across page reloads.
- Feel free to customize and improve the app as needed!
